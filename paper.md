My team is aiming to create a website that would act as a Twitter alternative platform for people all over the world to use. However, when we create this platform it’s important to consider the ethical responsibilities that we would have. We understand the issues of how what we consider to be free speech can be problematic. There are people in this world who don’t mind pushing the boundaries with free speech, so if we were to continue to make this a full-fledged website we would implement a TOS against hate speech such as racism, and also filter out explicitly known misinformation. Perhaps we would write an algorithm to avoid racist words and also flag posts that are potentially harmful. We know some people have limited bandwidth and slow internet, so we plan to implement low-quality images (using compression) and lazy load features to help those users out. As for professional responsibilities, it is crucial for us to store our passwords and account information securely by using a hash system. We will also respect our users by not collecting or selling their data to any companies or groups. Since someone’s posts can have a largely positive, neutral, or negative impact in different areas/topics depending on what they write; we understand and respect the impact of how our website would potentially affect society. Finally, we plan to keep our website free to help support others who don’t have enough budget to pay for a monthly subscription plan. If we need to support ourselves in the future we can resort to making a Patreon page which would be optional for our user base to enroll in. We would also consider having some bonus, non-necessary features behind a premium paywall in order to keep the site funded and give perks to those who choose to support us.
