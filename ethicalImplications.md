Write about the ethical and professional responsibilities in building the application you are making. DiscussÂ the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.

When making an app designed to spread messages across the internet, it is the company's responsibility to make sure the messages would not harm others. If there are malicious misinformation or hateful messages, it would be the company's job to take down these messages and encourage a better platform. The company should also take basic steps to ensure that the app will live up to customer and investors' expectations. Economically, we want to make sure our product will be in working condition when users want to use it. Additionally, we should make sure that our environmental impact when running the servers uses clean renewable energy to avoid worsening the global crisis of global warming.
